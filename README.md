## About Me

Anyone who knows me knows I love math, radios, and running. I'm currently a research assistant at Brigham Young University as an electrical engineering undergraduate. I study carrier acquisition for aeronautical telemetry communication channels. I have many interests including signal processing, autonomous vehicles, embedded programming, control systems, and electromagnetics.

## Projects

### Capstone

I am currently working on my Capstone Project at Brigham Young University for Sandia National Laboratory. We are developing a test bench for various texture algorithms outlined in Haralick's famous paper ["Textural Features for Image Classification"](http://haralick.org/journals/TexturalFeatures.pdf). We are specifically developing three algorithms in C++: a single-threaded, multi-threaded, and CUDA implementations. We are using SWIG to create a Python user interface.

### Autonomous Vehicle

This graduate level course consisted entirely of controlling a small RC car to detect lanes, avoid obstacles, and follow the rules of the road. We used an Intel RealSense camera for image, depth, and speed information. We also used a Nvidia GPU for processing. My car can now navigate the road using several types of lane-following algorithms.

### Laser Tag

For my Junior Design Project, I designed a fully-functional, real-time laser tag system with range of over 60 feet. I implemented analog receiver amplifier circuitry on a PCB, and developed software for the on-board FPGA signal processing unit in C. This unit interfaced well with other units designed by my classmates, so we were able to play laser tag by the end of the semester.

### Embedded Systems

The following projects were completed for an embedded systems lab. I programmed an FPGA in C to control a touchscreen display. All of these systems were real-time, interactive applications. These were done on bare-metal systems.

__Programmable Clock Display__: The system displays a digital clock. Depending on where the user touches the screen, either the hours, minutes, or seconds place increments or decrements.

__Simon Says__: The classic game of Simon Says where a sequence of colored rectangles appears, and the user must repeat the sequence to progress to the next level.

__Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe__: Using a minimax algorithm, this system displays a tic tac toe opponent that can determine the optimal strategy real-time. Thus the best the human player can do is tie.

__Whack-a-Mole__: This game is the classic whack-a-mole where the user must tap all of the moles before they disappear. As the game progresses, the game becomes progressively more difficult.

### Control Systems

__Python Simluations__: I created several simulations in Python from scratch that incorporate physics for three systems, including a mass-spring-damper system, a ball on beam system, and a quadcopter system. I then designed various controllers (PID, state-space, observer-based) to control the behavior of the systems. For example, I simulated a quadcopter in two dimensions with wind. I could command the quadcopter to go to various locations, and the controller would correctly control the motors to place the quadcopter where I commanded.

### Digital Signal Processing

__Direction-finder__: Using two microphones and MATLAB, I was able to correctly determine the direction from which an audible tone propagated through the lab based on the phase difference between the two signals.

__Image processing__: Compared various methods of image filtering and evaluated their efficiency. Types of filters included edge-finding, blurring, and frequency-domain analysis.

__FIR and Adaptive Filter design__: Developed an FIR filter to separate several audible tones into their respective Morse code signals that could then be transcribed. I also created an adaptive filter that could adapt to noise and remove it from the signal.

__Spectrogram__: Created a real-time spectrogram using MATLAB and a microphone and analyzed how various filters affected frequency components of musical signals.

### Computer Science

__TensorFlow__: I trained a TensorFlow neural net to identify various articles of clothing and another to identify stop signs and stop lights for my autonomous vehicle project.

__Datalog__: I created a parser for Datalog programs, then used that information to evaluate logical statements using SQL-like queries.

### Slovencina

Aj hovorim po slovensky! Napriek tomu, ze som American, byval som na slovenksu dva roky v Nitre, Ziline, Kosiciach, Trencine, Bratislave, a Banskej Bystrici. Casto som sa prestavovaval. Ak hovorite po slovensky, prosim vas, aby ma kontaktovali! Rad sa so Slovakmi rozpravam. Treba pouzivat taky krasny jazyk.
