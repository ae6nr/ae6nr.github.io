## About Me

Anyone who knows me knows I love math, radios, and running. I'm currently a research assistant at Brigham Young University as an electrical engineering undergraduate. I study carrier acquisition for aeronautical telemetry communication channels. I have many interests including signal processing, autonomous vehicles, embedded programming, control systems, and electromagnetics.

Aj hovorim po slovensky! Napriek tomu, ze som American, byval som na slovenksu dva roky v Nitre, Ziline, Kosiciach, Trencine, Bratislave, a Banskej Bystrici. Casto som sa prestavovaval. Ak hovorite po slovensky, prosim vas, aby ma kontaktovali! Rad sa so Slovakmi rozpravam. Treba pouzivat taky krasny jazyk.
