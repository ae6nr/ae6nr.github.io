# Projects

## WAAS Signal Demodulator

While at [Rincon](https://www.rincon.com), I wrote a WAAS signal demodulator in C++. I focused on general-purpose, reusable code that could easy be ported into other pojects. This project included several DSP principles, including spread-spectrum modulation, resampling filters, correlation filters, Viterbi decoding of convolutional codes, frame synchronization using distributed preambles, and interpreting received message packets. I was able to obtain all of the information that they asked for before my internship ended.

## Capstone Project

My team developed a test bench for various texture algorithms outlined in Haralick's famous paper ["Textural Features for Image Classification"](http://haralick.org/journals/TexturalFeatures.pdf) for [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov). We are specifically developed three algorithms in C++: a single-threaded, multi-threaded, and CUDA implementations. We used SWIG to create a Python user interface for ease of use.

## Autonomous Vehicle

This graduate level course consisted entirely of controlling a small RC car to detect lanes, avoid obstacles, and follow the rules of the road. We used an Intel RealSense camera for image, depth, and speed information. We also used a Nvidia GPU for processing. Our car navigated a to-scale road using several types of lane-following algorithms. An article and video about the project can be found [here](https://news.byu.edu/intellect/byu-offers-crash-course-in-self-driving-car-technology).

## Laser Tag

For my Junior Design Project, I designed a fully-functional, real-time laser tag system with range of over 60 feet. I implemented analog receiver amplifier circuitry on a PCB, and developed software for the on-board FPGA signal processing unit in C. This unit interfaced well with other units designed by my classmates, so we were able to play laser tag by the end of the semester.

## Embedded Systems

The following projects were completed for an embedded systems lab. I programmed an FPGA in C to control a touchscreen display. All of these systems were real-time, interactive applications. These were done on bare-metal systems.

__Programmable Clock Display__: The system displays a digital clock. Depending on where the user touches the screen, either the hours, minutes, or seconds place increments or decrements.

__Simon Says__: The classic game of Simon Says where a sequence of colored rectangles appears, and the user must repeat the sequence to progress to the next level.

__Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe__: This system displays a tic tac toe opponent that can determine the optimal strategy real-time using a minimax algorithm. Thus the best the human player can do is tie.

__Whack-a-Mole__: This game is the classic whack-a-mole where the user must tap all of the moles before they disappear. As the game progresses, the game becomes progressively more difficult.

## Control Systems

__Python Simulations__: I created several simulations in Python from scratch that incorporate physics for three systems, including a mass-spring-damper system, a ball on beam system, and a quadcopter system. I then designed various controllers (PID, state-space, observer-based) to control the behavior of the systems. For example, I simulated a quadcopter in two dimensions with wind. I could command the quadcopter to go to various locations, and the controller would correctly control the motors to place the quadcopter where I commanded.

## Digital Signal Processing

__Direction-finder__: Using two microphones and MATLAB, I was able to correctly determine the direction from which an audible tone propagated through a room based on the phase difference between the two signals.

__Image processing__: Compared various methods of image filtering and evaluated their efficiency. Types of filters included edge-finding, blurring, and frequency-domain analysis.

__FIR and Adaptive Filter design__: Developed an FIR filter to separate several audible tones into their respective Morse code signals that could then be transcribed. I also created an adaptive filter that could adapt to noise and remove it from the signal.

__Spectrogram__: Created a real-time spectrogram using MATLAB and a microphone and analyzed how various filters affected frequency components of musical signals.

## Computer Science

__TensorFlow__: I trained a TensorFlow neural net to identify stop signs and stop lights for my autonomous vehicle project.

__Datalog__: I created a Datalog parser, then used that information to evaluate logical statements using SQL-like queries.

# More Information

## What does AE6NR mean?
AE6NR is my amateur radio callsign. It is a short sequence of letters that is unique to me, so you can often find me on the internet by searching for those letters.

## Slovencina

Aj hovorim po slovensky! Napriek tomu, ze som American, byval som na slovenksu dva roky v Nitre, Ziline, Kosiciach, Trencine, Bratislave, a Banskej Bystrici. Casto som sa prestavovaval. Ak hovorite po slovensky, prosim vas, aby ma kontaktovali! Rad sa so Slovakmi rozpravam. Treba pouzivat taky krasny jazyk.
